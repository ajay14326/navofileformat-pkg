<h1>About the NAVO File Format Toolbox</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This toolbox was written to provide a Matlab interface to the various file formats used at the Naval Oceanographic Office.  All functions were written by Kelly Kearney.
</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>
The functions in this toolbox were written with Matlab version 7.0.4 and the Mapping Toolbox version 2.1 on Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems.  All functions should be operating system independent, although they have not been tested.  Some functions may be able to run on previous versions of Matlab, but this also has not been tested.
